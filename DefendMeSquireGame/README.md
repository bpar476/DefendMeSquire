# Defend Me Squire

A game by Ben Partridge.

Defend Me Squire was built with Unity 2019.3. It can be played with keyboard and mouse and targets Windows and Web.

This game was intended to be a learning experience of taking a Unity game from start to finish. There are a lot of things which could be improved and the game is very small. I'm moving on to something else after this but I hope this is a fun little demo and would love to hear some feedback.

Thanks for playing!
